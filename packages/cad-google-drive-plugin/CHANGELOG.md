# @mlightcad/cad-google-drive-plugin

## 1.7.6-preview.0

### Patch Changes

- feat: ships whole-drawing FIND search across all layouts with one-click navigation and an explicit current-layout-only mode in both the Vue and simple-UI shells. Paper-space viewports now hide VPLAYER-frozen layers, INSERT rendering shares block geometry and defers spatial indexes for faster opens, and headless export skips duplicate converts on a headless GPU. Plus mobile-bridge and DWG/DXF foundations, hatch pattern transform and mtext \pxq fixes, and Changesets pre mode for npm preview prereleases

## 1.7.5

### Patch Changes

- feat: adds OneDrive and Google Drive data-source plugins, upgrades the data model, and falls back when the linetype shader is broken. Speeds headless HTML export open and package builds, fixes SVG INSERT cloning and finite-extents framing, and stops dual font parse plus worker-pool fan-out during open. Also hides landing-page viewer chrome, defaults MSAL redirect to the current path, isolates the file-open theme, and swallows missed-font worker rejections.
