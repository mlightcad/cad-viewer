# @mlightcad/cad-simple-ui-plugin

## 1.6.2

### Patch Changes

- feat: adds an in-browser DWG/DXF to offline HTML converter, HTML export of paper-space viewports with layout switching, and a drawing layout switcher in the simple-ui toolbar. Object snap gains AutoCAD-style center ticks and intersection snaps. Overlay toolbars keep style controls while markup or measure is selected, restore named ACI colors, and restore undo for deleted entities. Arc-length measure locks onto circles, and hatch fills stay below linework in HTML export.

## 1.6.1

### Patch Changes

- feat: extends Design Review markup and measurement to the HTML viewer with sidecar persistence, aligned review icons, and HTML-only measure overlays that avoid forcing WebGL redraws. Also preserves absolute hatch colours when only lineweight is ByLayer, and documents GitMCP servers in the README and Cursor config
- Updated dependencies
  - @mlightcad/cad-simple-viewer@1.6.1

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- feat: adds Design Review markup and measurement overlays with sidecar JSON persistence, undoable edits, draw-style controls, and AutoCAD-style REVCLOUD/SKETCH tools. Review overlays pick by stroke, support in-place text and window/crossing selection, and render on HTML canvas without forcing WebGL redraws. Ships a zero-build CDN bootstrap example, makes LibreDWG DWG support host opt-in, and retires cad-html-exporter-cli in favor of cad-simple-viewer-cli

## 1.5.11

### Patch Changes

- feat: adds headless .scr script support to the simple-viewer CLI and waits for the scene to become idle before export so rendered output is complete. Example app bundles are split so data-model and three stay cacheable, isolating example chunks, and HTML runtime plugin options are fixed for more reliable offline HTML export workflows.
- Updated dependencies
  - @mlightcad/cad-simple-viewer@1.5.11

## 1.5.10

### Patch Changes

- feat: speeds up drawing open with progressive loading by default, a direct-batch convert fast path, and smarter rendering-cache heuristics that share compacted INSERT template geometry. Fonts load on demand during text draw, and picking is fixed so hollow lines are not selected via bbox while hatch islands stay selectable

  - @mlightcad/cad-simple-viewer@1.5.10

## 1.5.9

### Patch Changes

- feat: this release adds Czech localization, an Attribute Definition dialog, and an About dialog; improves XREF overlays, XATTACH defaults, and INSERT Off/Freeze layer behavior; ships a faster DXF pipeline with compacted block templates; expands offline HTML locales (Czech, Turkish); and documents the proprietary DWG converter plus Read the Docs API publishing
