# @mlightcad/pdf-renderer

## 1.7.7

### Patch Changes

- feat: adds Node HTML export with thumbnails and complex linetype SVG previews, plus a script-first CAD agent with measure APIs, searchable built-in scripts, and a Vue-free script console. Fixes layout framing via openViewMode, locked-layer edits, INSERT highlight/pan stability, agent tool streaming, and MTEXT ribbon hangs in production. Externalizes data-model in the HTML exporter Node build, pins @mlightcad packages to exact releases, and upgrades data-model/libredwg-converter and three.js rendering deps

## 1.7.7-preview.1

### Patch Changes

- fix: stops the MTEXT ribbon from hanging in production builds and externalizes data-model in the HTML exporter Node build so Node consumers resolve correctly. Pins @mlightcad package versions to exact releases for reproducible installs, and adds a development guide for contributors

## 1.7.7-preview.0

### Patch Changes

- feat: adds Node HTML export with thumbnails and complex linetype SVG previews, plus a script-first CAD agent with measure APIs, searchable built-in scripts, and a Vue-free script console. Fixes layout framing via openViewMode, locked-layer edits, INSERT highlight/pan stability, and agent tool streaming. Also upgrades data-model/libredwg-converter and three.js rendering deps

## 1.7.6

### Patch Changes

- feat: ships whole-drawing FIND with one-click navigation, Quick Select by entity handle, and paper-space fixes for osnap, properties, VPLAYER-frozen layers, and annotative MTEXT viewport scales. INSERT rendering shares block geometry, hatch islands and pattern lines stay correct, and HTML export adds base85 snapshots plus optional gzip chunks. Also fixes shared-geometry reading-mode tint, viewer teardown, and linear-time MTEXT parsing

## 1.7.6-preview.0

### Patch Changes

- feat: ships whole-drawing FIND search across all layouts with one-click navigation and an explicit current-layout-only mode in both the Vue and simple-UI shells. Paper-space viewports now hide VPLAYER-frozen layers, INSERT rendering shares block geometry and defers spatial indexes for faster opens, and headless export skips duplicate converts on a headless GPU. Plus mobile-bridge and DWG/DXF foundations, hatch pattern transform and mtext \pxq fixes, and Changesets pre mode for npm preview prereleases

## 1.7.5

### Patch Changes

- feat: adds OneDrive and Google Drive data-source plugins, upgrades the data model, and falls back when the linetype shader is broken. Speeds headless HTML export open and package builds, fixes SVG INSERT cloning and finite-extents framing, and stops dual font parse plus worker-pool fan-out during open. Also hides landing-page viewer chrome, defaults MSAL redirect to the current path, isolates the file-open theme, and swallows missed-font worker rejections.

## 1.7.4

### Patch Changes

- feat: adds a radius measure tool and async smart extents with cache and busy overlay, and maps PDF optional content groups to CAD layers. Fixes cover wipeout paint order, drawable scene extents, stalled font open overlays, PDF MText colours and INSERT labels, inline ACI-7 MText, selection glow scaling, Fit-to-screen measure badges, multi-attribute edit, and a font CDN notice

## 1.7.3

### Patch Changes

- feat: brings smart extents and AutoCAD saved-view zoom to live viewer toolbars, and cuts open-time stalls by speeding INSERT indexing and font regeneration. Fallback fonts preload before the first glyph bake so text no longer flashes with missing glyphs, and docs link the proprietary DWG converter install guide to the wiki

## 1.7.2

### Patch Changes

- feat: draws complex TEXT and SHAPE linetypes as strokes and glyphs, renders closed wide polylines as offset rings, and adds HTML export smart extents plus AutoCAD saved-view zoom. The CLI gains a self-hosted base URL and open-view, no-plot, and circle-sides options. Dynamic blocks and arc-aligned text come with the data-model upgrade. Drawing open is faster with font preload and lighter line batches, and fixes cover raster and OLE textures, PDF PDMODE, and progressive open.

## 1.7.1

### Patch Changes

- feat: adds a native AcGi PDF renderer with direct vector export and lower-memory text modes, plus HTML export that embeds progressive ACEX chunks, multi-file ZIP packages, and leaner multi-layout switching. Shared toolbar and notification engines land across viewers, with reading mode, mobile session accessories, and parallel package downloads. Fixes cover font sync, hatch shaders, mirrored INSERTs, OLE2Frame embeds, selection, and PDSIZE/highlight/dashed-line rendering

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- feat: adds a native AcGi PDF renderer that exports CAD databases to vector PDF without an SVG intermediate
